## What is Energy Psychology?

Energy psychology is a collection of mind-body techniques, like Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) and Thought Field Therapy (TFT), that work with the body's energy systems to promote emotional and physical well-being. Unlike traditional talk therapy, energy psychology focuses on identifying and releasing energy blockages associated with negative emotions. Think of it as acupuncture, but instead of needles, you use your fingertips to tap on specific acupressure points.
